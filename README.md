# Rigor Demo

## Last Updated - Jan 3, 2020 (v0.2)

### Demo Purpose
* The goal of this demo flow is to tell a story that is relatable for developers, managers, and executives on how Rigor helps customers
  * Monitor the availability, speed and performance of their websites to see how end users are actually experiencing them from various perspectives (environment, connection speed, device type, viewport, geographic location, etc.)
  * Visualize the user experience, using video, filmstrips, images, waterfall charts, and 50+ speed metrics
  * Monitor mission-critical conversion paths, user flows, single page applications (SPAs), and business transactions for slow downs and user experience issues
  * Set performance and alert thresholds, then route issues to the proper teams so they can find and fix issues quickly
  * Incorporate performance testing into the development process, to prevent issues before they are pushed into production
* Most customer demos are done using the customer's own public site when possible. You can use these demo steps as a suggested flow for custom demos as well.
